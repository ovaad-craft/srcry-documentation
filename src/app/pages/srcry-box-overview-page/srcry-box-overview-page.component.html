            The <strong>box size</strong> library is extremely useful on its own however it can be even more flexible when used with the <strong>srcryBox</strong> class&#46;  This class gives you an extra layer of functionality that allows you to fully control how your elements scale from one screen size to another&#46;  This is done through a set of properties defined on this class as CSS variables which hook into a series of intricate equations resulting as the scaling behavior of your elements&#46;
        </p>

        <p class="srcryTxt textContent">
            In order to use the <strong>srcryBox</strong> class you simply add it to your element&#39;s class attribute and define the srcryBox properties in your own class as shown in the example below&#46;
        </p>

        <pre class="srcryTxt codeFrame">
            <code
                [highlight]="Demo_01A"
                [languages]="['xml']"
                [lineNumbers]="true"
            >
            </code>
        </pre>

        <pre class="srcryTxt codeFrame">
            <code
                [highlight]="Demo_01B"
                [languages]="['css']"
                [lineNumbers]="true"
            >
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p class="srcryTxt textContent">
            Before we begin exploring the properties available on the srcryBox class it&#39;s worth pointing out that each property has 2 modifiers called <strong>nudge-chunk</strong> and <strong>nudge-slice</strong>&#46;  The purpose of including these modifiers is to slightly increase or decrease the size of your element should you run into a situation where one size is too small or adapts too subtly and the next size and or speed is too large or adapts too rapidly&#46;  A <strong>nudge-slice</strong> is a tiny flexible value that grows larger as the screen size expands and a <strong>nudge-chunk</strong> is equivalent to 8 nudge slices&#46;

            You&#39;ll be able to learn more and see how this works in the pages that follow so we won&#39;t go further in depth here because we&#39;ll just be getting ahead of ourself&#46;  Go to the next page to learn about the first set of properties or select one from the list below if you&#39;re already familiar and are just here to refresh yourself&#46;
