            The <b>squishGrowth</b> properties are used to make an element's dimensions expand as the screen size shrinks.  For example, the <b>squishGrowth-h</b> properties make the height of the element increase as the width of the screen decreases and the <b>squishGrowth-w</b> properties makes the width of the element increase as the height of the screen decreases.

            This functionality can be useful for handling a lot of the changes we typically make to our layouts when transitioning from mobile to tablets and laptops.  If you recall on the introduction page there's a demonstration of a navbar that grows taller when you decrease the width of the frame, that was done with the <b>squishGrowth</b> property.  Below is a chart of all the <b>squishGrowth</b> properties and how they're to be used.

            The following example demonstrates the <b>squishGrowth-w</b> properties to show how they work.

            The <b>squishGrowth-h</b> properties work the same exact way with the exception of the element's height increasing as the width of the page decreases.  The following demonstration allows you to experiment with both properties to see the results.
