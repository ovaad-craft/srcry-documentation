            The box size library is a collection of 198 size definitions that can be used to define the size of your elements, margins and padding.  To make them more intuitive to use they're organized into nine sizes with two scales and eleven growth speeds.  Before we go any further lets explain what each of these 3 parts are.

            <p>
                The 9 sizes are called <b>micro, xTiny, tiny, xSmall, small, loMed, hiMed, large</b> and <b>jumbo</b>.  Seeing that they're designed to be adaptable each name should be regarded arbitrarily as a relative range of sizes rather than exact pixel values.

            <h2 class="srcryTxt sectionSubTitle">Scale</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned there are two scales for each size which is simply <b>1</b> or <b>2</b>.  The purpose is to broaden the range of each size by providing two core sizes to scale from.

            <h2 class="srcryTxt sectionSubTitle">Speed</h2>
            <p>
                The eleven speeds are used just like the scale settings which is applying any number between <b>1</b> and <b>11</b> to your settings.  The speed controls how subtly or drastically an elements scales with the size of the screen with <b>1</b> being the slowest / most subtle and <b>11</b> being the fastest / most drastic.

                Combining these parts into a usable property is done with the following syntax.

            To give a real world example for how this works lets look at some code.

            The example above shows an element that uses higher speed settings in its width and height definitions.  Lets see what happens with the same exact size and scale but with lower speed settings.

            In this example the blue box hardly grows at all when you scale the window to its maximum size.  Not only can you define the size of your elements with this library, but you can use it to define your margins and padding as well.

            To understand this even better, lets take a deeper look under the hood with the following demonstration.
